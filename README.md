# Direct Cache Simulator

## Requirements
#### Input: 
* Block Size
* MM Memory Size (either blocks or words)
* Cache Memory Size (either blocks or words)
* Memory Access Time
* Cache Access Time
* Main Memory Values
* Program flow to be simulated and other parameters deemed needed (example: can simulate cache problem set # 4,5,6)


#### Output:
* Number of cache hits

* Number of cache miss

* Miss penalty

* Average memory access time

* Total memory access time

* Snapshot of the cache memory

* With option to output result in text file
